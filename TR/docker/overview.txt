Docker- It makes it possible to get far more apps running on the same old servers and it also makes it very easy to package and ship programs
-- Why embrace docker?
--> Containers, use shared operating systems. This means they are much more efficient than hypervisors in system resource terms. Instead of virtualizing hardware, containers rest on top of a single Linux instance. This means you can "leave behind the useless 99.9 percent VM junk, leaving you with a small, neat capsule containing your application". 
With a perfectly tuned container system, you can have as many as four-to-six times the number of server application instances as you can using Xen or KVM VMs on the same hardware.

Useful Docker commands--
docker â€“version
docker pull
docker run
docker ps
docker ps -a
docker exec
docker stop
docker kill
docker commit
docker login
docker push
docker images
docker rm
docker rmi
docker build


get apt -- command to ...


WSL --- Window subsystem for Linux 
feature in windows 10 and + for using linux commands inside windows.

- Needs to be turned on to use Docker desktop

Containerisation --
to remove dependiencies on OS containers/Machine specification are used 


What is the difference between Kill and Terminate??

ps-- current running things
ps -l -- shows all the things which were done cureent+ stoped along with their proper execution time

rm -- remove, things are removed from docker only , can be used in future
rm -i -- things are removed from host machine also, they are permanently deleted


CONTAINER 
- Have base  images but NO Operating system
- lightweight than VMs
- docker files have base-files (just like stdio.h of c++)

You may have multuiple containers
- one maybe running the frontend and other running the backend

- Kubernetes 
   - Open source platform, created by google
   - manage diff containers
   - can't create container
   - how will 100 containers be managed??? with help of ports
   - it has a host and the host has multiple ports and each port has multiple containers
   - if workload immediately increases then it will create one more port automatically and when requirement decreases then the ports are dismental automatically

DOCKER IMAGE INSTALLATION --
- go to hub.docker.com
- downlaod image (by running command in cmd)
- run image by this command:
   docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 nadav42/minesweeper
               |    |   |   |    |           |
   initialize   remove port image&container  name of image
