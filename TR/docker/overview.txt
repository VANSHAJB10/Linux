CONTAINER 
- Have base  images but NO Operating system
- lightweight than VMs
- docker files have base-files (just like stdio.h of c++)

You may have multuiple containers
- one maybe running the frontend and other running the backend

- Kubernetes 
   - Open source platform, created by google
   - manage diff containers
   - can't create container
   - how will 100 containers be managed??? with help of ports
   - it has a host and the host has multiple ports and each port has multiple containers
   - if workload immediately increases then it will create one more port automatically and when requirement decreases then the ports are dismental automatically

DOCKER IMAGE INSTALLATION --
