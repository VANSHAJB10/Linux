Starting process-


Template - 
1. Main copy of VM
2. Used to create and provision a new VM
3. includes an installed guest operating system and a set of applications.
4. It captures the configuration of software, configuration of hardware, and the software installed on the virtual machine on which the template is based.
5. Whereas a template serves as a baseline image for creating multiple VMs, a VM clone is an exact copy, sharing many of the hardware and software configuration settings, including unique identifiers.

6. You can not power on/off or edit a template.
7. A template offers a more secure way of preserving a virtual machine configuration that you want to deploy many times.
8. good for mass VM deployment in the production environment.
9. You can convert the template back to Virtual Machine to update the baseline template with the latest configuration and again convert back to the template to be used for future deployment of VMs
    BUT  You cannot convert back the cloned Virtual Machine. (after cloning it)
10. You can not create a Template from a VM that is powered on. BUT Clone can be created with the VM that is powered on.



Steps to create a Template- 


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Clone -

Tags - used to filter
        - OS of Guest
        - Power on/off status

** To make a tag u need to create a category first **
Tap on Tags and custom attributes >> Create a New category >> select one machine or multiple machine depending on how many machines tags should be assigned >>
  Assign a name >> Create

** Create Tag **
Then go on to Create Tag Option ----  Write name >> Description >> Select Category

** Assign tag **


** Whether tag is assigned or not? **
If some tag is present in Remove tag option then it is assigned


Q- Difference between Sleep, suspended mode?
Ans- SLEEP - Only RAMs are powered on , hardware are not
    SUSPENDED - Data is copied to hard disk from the RAM and and then system goes to sleep.

Edit the 'Fault tolerance' if required while turning on the HA in Admission control option in that window only

** DRS **
-Distributed resource scheduler
In diff platform diff work is going on, and we need to schedule all the resources for smooth processing.

HA is req to fetch the resources from diff sources on the cloud, in case the need for additional resources arises
Steps--> Go to the Available resource (Region01 COMP01) > Settings > vSphereAvailability > Turn ON Vsphere HA (Click edit on right side and then turn it on.)

Turn on DRS in similar way 
Has 3 options - Manual , Automatic, Semi-Automatic
CPU Overload can be set in the next option on the same window
Power Management has two option - Manual , Automatic

If DRS Is off then if the requirement changes then it will not increase it will stay fixed and may result in crashing the resource intensive task

To check if they are active or not - Check the summary (if there is a entry for DRS in the summary then it means it ON)

** Migration **
Steps--> Select a machine > Right click on it > Migrate
!!! Important!  -->  TURN Off HA before Migration, 
                      because Migration needs a boundary like fixed RAM , Fixed memory etc 
                      but if HA is ON then it will fetch resources from cloud if it feels requirements are rising; causing failure of migration.

Select a resoure where u want to migrate. (keep on tapping dropdown till it is over, ELSE there will be error)

** Alarm **
-Pre built -- Prebuilt events are called Kernel Events

New Alarm can also be added or prebuilt alarms can be sued.

** Mounting **
