Q- Difference between Sleep, suspended mode?
Ans- SLEEP - Only RAMs are powered on , hardware are not
    SUSPENDED - Data is copied to hard disk from the RAM and and then system goes to sleep.

Edit the 'Fault tolerance' if required while turning on the HA in Admission control option in that window only

** DRS **
-Distributed resource scheduler
In diff platform diff work is going on, and we need to schedule all the resources for smooth processing.

HA is req to fetch the resources from diff sources on the cloud, in case the need for additional resources arises
Steps--> Go to the Available resource (Region01 COMP01) > Settings > vSphereAvailability > Turn ON Vsphere HA (Click edit on right side and then turn it on.)

Turn on DRS in similar way 
Has 3 options - Manual , Automatic, Semi-Automatic
CPU Overload can be set in the next option on the same window
Power Management has two option - Manual , Automatic

If DRS Is off then if the requirement changes then it will not increase it will stay fixed and may result in crashing the resource intensive task

To check if they are active or not - Check the summary (if there is a entry for DRS in the summary then it means it ON)

** Migration **
Steps--> Select a machine > Right click on it > Migrate
!!! Important!  -->  TURN Off HA before Migration, 
                      because Migration needs a boundary like fixed RAM , Fixed memory etc 
                      but if HA is ON then it will fetch resources from cloud if it feels requirements are rising; causing failure of migration.

Select a resoure where u want to migrate. (keep on tapping dropdown till it is over, ELSE there will be error)
